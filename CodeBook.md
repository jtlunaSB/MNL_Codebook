## [REWARDS CODEBOOK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xPwSyZM-LxuBBW81Z8x22ubcu7RPGTVdL532QOheOGA/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=114040915278348592271)

#### Conceptual Framework

Rewards are in-game markers or progression indicators that reinforce player behaviors and generate positive feelings. The distinction between minor and major rewards is operationalized through both perceptual intensity (pixel movement and auditory volume in the audio-visual pipeline) and reward magnitude.

### MINOR REWARDS

**Definition:**

A discrete reinforcement event resulting from a single player action, characterized by localized visual effects and moderate audio feedback. Minor rewards represent individual instances of progress or achievement within the game's core mechanics.

**Operational Criteria:**

- Results from one player action (e.g., one swipe, one click)
- Produces limited pixel movement (localized to specific game elements)
- Generates moderate volume audio feedback
- Represents incremental progress toward larger goals

**Counting Rules:**

1. **Simultaneous same-type events = 1 minor reward**
 > (e.g., two jewel matches from one action = 1 minor reward)
2. **Simultaneous different-type events = multiple minor rewards**
 > (e.g., one match + breaking boxes = 2 minor rewards)
3. **Count by reward category, not quantity within category**
 > (e.g., breaking 1-6 boxes = 1 minor reward)

**Examples by Category:**

- **Match/Elimination**: 1-3 jewel matches, breaking 1-6 boxes/obstacles
- **Collection**: Obtaining points, currency, resources, items, ammo, XP
- **Character Enhancement**: Increasing health capacity, equipping items
- **Economy**: Purchasing small items, selling items, crafting items
- **Environment**: Building, organizing, or upgrading gameplay spaces
- **Special Items**: Activating single power-ups (e.g., spinning top trigger)
- **Incremental Progress**: Advancing one step in mini-games (e.g., one dungeon level)
- **Team Events**: Team achieves a minor collective goal

**Tally Method:**

 Sum all distinct reward categories triggered by player actions within the measurement period.

### MAJOR REWARDS

**Definition:**

 A substantial reinforcement event distinguished by significantly amplified audio-visual presentation (louder volume, extensive pixel movement, novel/rare visuals) that marks meaningful achievement or progression milestones.

**Operational Criteria:**

- Produces extensive pixel movement (affects large portions of screen or full-screen effects)
- Generates high-volume audio feedback (distinctly louder than minor rewards)
- Often introduces novel visual elements not present in standard gameplay
- Represents significant advancement or completion of goals
- Generally rarer and more valuable than minor rewards

**Counting Rules:**

1.  **Major rewards supersede minor reward counting**
 (e.g., 4+ cascade combo = 1 major reward, not 4+ minor rewards)
2. **Threshold-based triggers count as major:**
    - 4+ simultaneous minor reward events
    - 2+ special items activating together
    - Round/level completion

**Examples by Category:**

- **Progression Milestones**: Leveling up, beating levels, winning matches/rounds
- **Cascade Events**: 4+ cascading matches, 2+ items triggering simultaneously
- **High-Value Acquisition**: Rare items, large currency amounts, bonus points
- **Achievement Completion**: Major quests/objectives, unlock achievements
- **Access Expansion**: Unlocking hidden levels, maps, or game areas
- **Major Purchases**: Acquiring expensive or rare in-game items
- **Victory States**: Winning rounds in any game mode (jewel matches, dungeon climbs, mini-games)

> \[!NOTE]
> **Progression Note:** Major rewards often follow a difficulty curve—more frequent early in gameplay to onboard players, becoming progressively rarer and requiring greater effort/time investment as players advance.

## PUNISHMENTS CODEBOOK

#### **Conceptual Framework**
Punishments are negative consequences or unpleasant effects that follow player actions (or inaction), designed to discourage specific behaviors or signal failure states. The distinction between minor and major punishments is operationalized through **perceptual intensity** (pixel movement and auditory volume in the audio-visual pipeline), **cost magnitude**, and **impact on gameplay continuity**.

### MINOR PUNISHMENTS

**Definition:**

 A discrete negative consequence resulting from player action or inaction, characterized by localized visual effects and moderate audio feedback. Minor punishments create setbacks or resource depletion without interrupting core gameplay flow.
 
**Operational Criteria:**

- Results from player action, inaction, or opponent success
- Produces limited pixel movement (localized to specific game elements)
- Generates moderate volume audio feedback (may include negative sound cues)
- Creates setbacks but maintains gameplay continuity
- Represents incremental costs that accumulate over time

**Counting Rules:**

1. Count each distinct punishment category triggered
 > (e.g., losing health + losing an item = 2 minor punishments)
2. Single resource type depletion = 1 minor punishment
 > (e.g., losing 5 moves in one action = 1 minor punishment)
3. Opponent achievements count as player punishments
 > (opponent progress disadvantages the player)

**Examples by Category:**

- Resource Depletion: Losing time, losing moves, losing mana/strength points
- Defensive Loss: Losing health points, losing shield points, losing armor/defenses
- Item Loss: Losing in-game items, losing equipment, losing collectibles
- Environmental Hazards: Triggering bombs, traps, or enemy-enabled weapons
- Physical Setbacks: Avatar injured by crash, fall, or minor collision
- Opponent Progress: Opponent achieves a minor goal or reward
- Psychological Feedback: In-game discouragement messages (e.g., "Too slow!", "Try again!")

**Tally Method:**

 Sum all distinct punishment categories triggered within the measurement period.

### MAJOR PUNISHMENTS

**Definition:**

 A substantial negative consequence distinguished by significantly amplified audio-visual presentation (louder negative audio, extensive pixel movement, dramatic visual effects) that marks critical failure, elimination, or significant setback requiring recovery or restart.

**Operational Criteria:**

- Produces extensive pixel movement (affects large portions of screen or full-screen effects)
- Generates high-volume negative audio feedback (distinctly louder/more jarring than minor punishments)
- Often introduces dramatic visual elements (death animations, failure screens, elimination effects)
- Interrupts or terminates gameplay flow (requires respawn, restart, or transition)
- Represents significant loss of progress or achievement opportunity

**Counting Rules:**

1. Major punishments supersede minor punishment counting
 > (e.g., avatar death encompasses health loss—count only the major punishment)
2. Terminal or interrupting events qualify as major:
    - Avatar death/elimination
    - Complete loss of match/round/level
    - Failure to meet critical objectives within time limits

**Examples by Category:**

- **Avatar Elimination**: Avatar dies, avatar destroyed, character knocked out
- **Respawn States**: Avatar waiting for respawn, temporary removal from gameplay
- **Time Failures**: Running out of time for objectives, missing critical deadlines
- **Opponent Victory**: Opponent achieves a major goal, opponent wins significant advantage
- **Match Loss**: Player loses the game, player loses the match, team loses
- **Objective Failure**: Failed to complete major quest, failed critical mission objectives
- **Escalating Consequences**: Enemy adds obstacles due to player failure (e.g., Royal Kingdom enemy survival penalty)

> \[!NOTE]
> **Impact Note:** Major punishments typically result in one or more of the following: loss of accumulated progress, forced gameplay interruption, requirement to retry or restart, significant disadvantage in competitive scenarios, or narrative/progression setbacks.

#### AUDIO-VISUAL PIPELINE MARKERS

**Minor Punishments:**

- **Visual**: Localized screen shake, health bar depletion, item removal animation, damage indicators, warning symbols
- **Audio**: Moderate negative sound effects (thuds, cracks, warning beeps), damage sounds, loss indicators

**Major Punishments:**

- **Visual**: Full-screen effects, death/elimination animations, dramatic camera movements, failure screens, extensive particle effects, screen fade/transition
- **Audio**: Loud dramatic sounds (explosions, death sounds), failure music stings, dramatic audio cues, extended negative sound sequences

> \[!NOTE]
> **NOTES FOR CODERS**
 > - **Mutual Exclusivity**: When an event qualifies as a major punishment, do not also count it as minor punishments (e.g., death includes health loss—count only the major punishment)
 > - **Action vs. Inaction**: Both player mistakes (setting off trap) and failures to act (running out of time) count as punishments
 > - **Opponent-Relative**: Opponent achievements disadvantage the player and are coded as player punishments
 > - **Accumulation Matters**: Multiple minor punishments may create conditions for major punishments, but code them as they occur
 > - **Context Sensitivity**: Similar events may be minor or major depending on game state (e.g., losing health early vs. final health point leading to death)
 > - **Respawn Periods**: The waiting state itself is a major punishment, separate from the death event that preceded it

## Specific Reward-Punishment Categories

#### Major-Minor Distinction

The distinction between major and minor will follow the established norms; see the **operational criteria** above for major/minor rewards/punishments. Briefly, discrepancies between pixel and visual movements, audio levels, and game progression delineate major vs minor rewards and punishments.

#### Counting

Counting rules for rewards and punishments will also follow the established norms, see **counting rules** above. Briefly, distinct-types of minor events are counted independently, same-types of minor events are counted holistically, opponent achievements are counted as player punishments, major rewards/punishments supersede minor, and threshold/terminal events qualify as major.

> [!CAUTION]
> Unlike the major/minor rewards which were mutually exclusive, specific reward categories might overlap. For instance, an instrumental reward (receiving a cape item in Minecraft) is also a status reward (the cape carries status), or a social reward (a pleasant, interactive conversation with an AI in a TellTale game) may count as an instrumental reward (raising "relationship points" with the associated character).

#### Reward-Opportunities

Not recieving a reward does not automatically count as a punishment. A punishment is not the negation of a reward, rather, it _adds_ something which the player would _not_ want to happen.

#### Simultaneity of Events
If event A (e.g. first barrel breaks) is still occurring (visual, audio) while event B (e.g. second barrel breaks) begins OR if event A concludes with the beginning of event B (e.g. first-into-second level-up), then these same-type events are counted as one minor reward.

> This category does not neccesarily refer to game elements _responding_ to the player; for instance enemy deaths would **not** be coded because those originate from a source (the enemy)

> [!TIP]
> Non-characterized mail: The rewards themselves may still be instrumental, but opening mail with reward would also, in this case, be systemic due to a reward (getting anything) originating from the game itself

### Systemic Punishments

**Definition:**

Player-directed non-tangible nor quantifiable discouragement of behavior originating from no characterized source.

**Coding Criteria:**

- Record loss **screens** wherever they occur

> [!TIP]
> In many games' cases, the most popular manifestation of this will be player-character death by loss of hit points (the consequence is death -an obvious punishment- the game system is hit points).
> At these moments, the game is telling the player "Do not do this / Do not let this happen"

## Loot Boxes

**Definition**: Receiving a mystery reward with the potential of getting something highly valuable. Randomization of the value of the reward. These are often containerized like in a chest or box with mystery objects inside. But this could also be as simple as flipping cards which hide the value of the reward.

---

---

## Rewards

In game markers or progression marker gained from an activity that brings about positive feelings and reinforces behaviors

### Minor Rewards

Any connected  marker of reinforcement or progression (like a jewel match, breaking a box, getting an item, or having an item set off) that occurs as the result of an action.

**Examples:** 

- Obtain points
- Obtain currency or coins
- Obtain resource/item
- Obtain experience points (XP)
- Find/receive ammo pack
- Increase health point capacity 
- Equip item
- Purchase small item

> **Notes from Royal Kingdom**: We define minor reward counts as a reaction reward set. For example a minor reward in Royal Kingdom is matching the jewels (1). If you create two matches simultaneously that still counts as 1 reward. However if from 1 action you make two matches and break 4 boxes, that counts as 2 minor rewards because you receive the reward of matching and the reward of breaking boxes. 

### Major Rewards

Distinctly larger reinforcer marked by louder volume, significant increase in visuals or novel items or visuals compared to the rewards around it (like a large combo move or winning a round) that occurs as the result of an action. 

**Examples:**

- Level up
- beat a level or win the match
- receive rare in-game item or reward
- complete a major game objective or quest
- bonus points or large amount of currency
- access previously hidden level or map
- achieve a major goal
- purchase expensive/rare in-game item

> [!NOTE]
> **Notes from Royal Kingdom**: We define major reward counts as a larger reaction reward set. For example a major reward in Royal Kingdom is setting off a chain reaction 4 or more (4+) cascading matches, setting off 2+ items, and winning the game are examples of major rewards (these do not need to be  counted in the minor rewards, for example if you have a 5 jewel match combo, you only need to log 1 major reward rather than 5 minor rewards)

## Punishments

Punishments are all negative and unpleasant effects following the player’s actions to discourage them from continuing that action

### Minor Punishments

Any marker of punishment 

**Examples:**

- Lose Time/moves
- Lose health points
- Lose shield points
- Lose an in-game item
- Set off a bomb, trap, or agent-enabled weapon 
- Opponent achieves a minor goal or reward
- Avatar injured by crash or fall
- Discouragement 
- Lose mana or strength points

> [!NOTE]
> **Notes from Royal Kingdom**: For example a minor punishment in Royal Kingdom is the decrease in available moves.

### Major Punishments

Distinctly larger punishment marked by clearly negative effect or outcome

**Examples:** 

- Avatar dies
- avatar waiting for respawn
- run out of time
- opponent achieves a major goal
- player or team loses the game or match
- player failed objective or goal

> [!NOTE]
> **Notes from Royal Kingdom**: For example a major punishment in Royal Kingdom is losing a round, or not killing an enemy in time and they add obstacles to the board.

### Detailed Rewards

### Reward Source: Any type of action or mechanism in the game that triggers the generation of items.

- Defeating an enemy
- Opening a treasure chest
- Drawing from a deck of cards
- Playing a fishing minigame and catching a fish
- Gathering plants in the forest biome with your herbalism skill

### Reward Container: An abstract data structure holding the rewards. Not to be confused with an actual container that could be found in-game.

- Loot Table
- Drop Table
- Loot Box
- Random Distribution System
- Loot Pool
- Gacha Box
- Prize Box
- Random Selection

### Items: The actual rewards the player gets. 

#### Positive Reinforcement

- **Gaining Items:** The player can, for example, find an item through exploration or receive it as a reward for defeating an opponent or completing a task.
  - Currency
  - Card
  - Token
  - Resource
  - Skin
  - Equipment
  - Weapon
- **Access:** to new areas or unlocking previously restricted items.
- **New skills and perks:** these types of rewards add interest to the game's content. It usually takes the form of new gaming mechanism
- **Extra time:** a solution used in games where the player is under time pressure. As a result of the right action, the player has the chance to extend the time frame in which they must fit in order to succeed. This type of reward primarily evokes a feeling of relief.
- **Points:** make a player's skill level measurable. They provide the ability to both compare your performance over time and compare your own performance to that of other players.
- **Praise:** it is one of the least "tangible" forms of reward, but this does not mean that it has a worse effect than other rewards. Depending on the type of game, it can take the form of a simple on-screen message, graphic or sound effects, or e. g. praise spoken by an NPC, or player to player praise
- **Add More or decrease as needed**

#### Negative Reinforcement
- **Removal of Debuff/Threat/Negative Item**

> **Simple Fixed Reward:** The act of rewarding players sounds simple enough on paper – the player does an action and gets a reward in return

> **Dynamic Variable Reward:** Decoupling –specifically separating the source from the reward– this allows to change the types of rewards and the likelihood players get from a source through an intermediate container

> Negative Punishment

> - Losing points: losing points that a player has previously accumulated through their hard work will undoubtedly be seen as a negative consequence. As with rewards, points are a measurable indicator of how a player is doing - losing points shows them in a very direct way that they have made a mistake.
> - Loss of: items or positive effects.

> Positive Punishment

> - Going back to the last checkpoint or to the beginning of the game: As a result of a mistake, the player is taken back to the previous checkpoint or to the beginning of the game and must complete the sequence all over again.\
> - Slow movements or other negative perks: when using this type of punishment, it is important to ensure that the negative effect wears off after some time or that the player can remove it by appropriate actions

**Interactivity**

This refers to the notion that the action and stimuli in the activity changes based on the input or behaviour of the player. An activity that involves active player involvement and interaction may be considered interactive, whereas non-interactive activities involve passive viewing of an activity or viewing others, wherein the participant does not directly influence the outcome. All video games predominantly feature interactive elements, whereas this is not essential to gambling.

**Monetisation**

This category refers to the financial elements of play, including: (1) free/earned currency of game contextual value only (e.g., progression, completion), (2) free/earned currency that yields loyalty points exchangeable for credit, gifts or items of monetary value, (3) optional purchasable “vanity”/cosmetic items that do not impact the game mechanics, (4) optional purchasable currency for playing purposes (e.g., progression, completion), (5) optional purchasable currency that can be exchanged for gifts or other items, and (6) mandatory payment, entry fee or subscription to play. A useful qualifier in considering these types is whether the currency is redeemable for money or an equivalent (e.g., Bitcoin), including goods or services from the activity provider. The legal definition of gambling in many contexts typically refers to monetary payout to the player.

**Betting/wagering mechanics**

This category refers to the player’s option to stake something in their possession on the outcome of an event. It was recognised that, in some activities, players are able to engage in betting using virtual currencies and items that do not have any recognised financial value. It was therefore important to distinguish the mechanics of betting from its outcome in order to appropriately identify forms of simulated gambling.

**Role of skill versus luck in determining outcomes**

This refers to the way in which outcomes are determined in the activity, including (1) entirely determined by skill (e.g., competition); (2) entirely determined by chance or algorithms (i.e., draw, lottery), and (3) a combination of randomly generated or predetermined outcomes and skill-based outcomes.

**The nature of outcomes**

This refers to the outcome of player input and interactions, including betting and wagering mechanics. This may include (1) no indicator of outcome or progression, (2) non-financial indicators (e.g., virtual currency, points, unlocks, ranks, declaration of a winner), and (3) financial outcome (i.e., a payout). It was recognised that a typical requirement of gambling was financial outcomes.

**Structural fidelity**

This category refers to the degree of realism and structural resemblance of an activity to an established gambling (e.g., blackjack) activity. This includes: (1) minimal or no resemblance of a recognised activity, (2) some resemblance to a known activity, and (3) high level of parity to known activity.

**Context**

This category refers to the structural and situational positioning of an activity, either as (1) an activity is a stand-alone activity (e.g., a console game), (2) an activity is positioned within a larger activity (e.g., a mini-game within a console game), or (3) an activity linked to an external activity or service (e.g., a free-play game in an online casino).

**Centrality**

This refers to the proportion of gaming or gambling experiences within the typical experience of the activity, including with respect to gambling whether (1) gambling activity is the primary and exclusive activity, (2) gambling activity is secondary and mandatory, or (3) gambling activity is secondary and optional.

**Advertising**
This category refers to the presence of linked advertising material, particularly in relation to gambling activities. Some activities may not include features of gambling (e.g., betting) but nevertheless function as promotional material for financial gambling activities. Types include: (1) no advertising material, (2) presence of advertising for simulated gambling activities, (3) presence of brand-only advertising for gambling operators (online or land-based), and (4) presence of advertising for specific gambling activities and products (online or land-based). This category was included on the basis that some digital activities may feature links to recognised gambling, thereby enabling exposure to gambling and fluidity of transition between gaming and gambling.

### Violence

“We defined violence as acts in which the aggressor causes or attempts to cause physical injury or death to another character. We did not include accidental actions that led to unintentional physical harm, the effects of natural disasters, or the presence of dangerous obstacles that could not be attributed to the actions of a particular character. A violent incident was defined as an uninterrupted display of violence by a character or a group of characters. We defined characters broadly, including personified objects that attacked either the player or other characters. We did not code as violence any intentional acts of physical force that represent normal play in a sports game (eg, tackling in football or checking in hockey), because the intention of the player is technically to stop the other player without causing injury. We did code excessive physical contact in sports games, such as punching or otherwise attacking another player (eg, after the football play was over). To quantify the amount of violence, we manually recorded the starting and ending times of each incident of violence toward other characters (hours, minutes, and seconds from the beginning of the tape).

In video games, characters often engage in a series of violent acts that are punctuated by brief periods of time spent running toward the next encounter. For consistency, we established a rule that a series of violent acts would be coded as 1 violent incident only if individual acts of violence were separated by fewer than 10 seconds of nonviolent behavior. For each violent incident, we recorded the type of weapons used for violence, whether the violent incident resulted in injury, and the number of character deaths attributable to the violent incident. In addition, for each game, we noted whether injuring characters or destroying objects is rewarded or is necessary to advance in the game, whether the player could select weapons, and whether any of the following content was present: alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs, profanity, and sex. Finally, we also looked for the presence of music from explicit-content–labeled recordings, because a recent Federal Trade Commission report found that 2 music companies had approved the use of music with parental advisory labels in E-rated video games.”
